# Event-Handling-with-ImageView

Use	an	ImageView	to	hold	the	images,	and	three	separate	buttons	(one	for	core	java,	
eventful	approach	and	art	and	science)	to	load	the	different	images.		Design	your	
screen	using	a	layout	pane	of	your	choice	(Border	Pane,	Grid	Pane)	and	be	sure	to	
line	up	the	buttons	with	either	a	HBox	or	VBox	layout	(Horizontal,	Vertical)	so	that	
your	screen	looks	professional.		Include	a	title	TextView	on	your	screen	that	says	
“Java	Books”	or	something	similar.
